# Models

## Cube2.glb

OxyCube borrowed from [ritka_admin](https://github.com/ritka-admin) for reference,
but with partially fixed texture coordinates and with oxy logo baked inside the file.

## Cube3.glb

Cube2.glb but with fixed texture coordinates

## Duck.glb

Duck model from glTF-Sample-Models repository: [Duck](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/main/2.0/Duck)

Initially didn't render as expected, because duck's mesh is large, and it's scaled down with additional info stored in parent node.

## Duck2.glb

Duck.glb but with camera removed and with shrunk mesh

## Fox.glb

Fox model from glTF-Sample-Models repository: [Fox](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/main/2.0/Fox)

Doesn't work, because I don't know why

## Fox2.glb

Fox.glb but with animations, rig and root node removed, and model (not mesh) scaled down.
Also changed center of coordinates for meshes.
Full-scale model was properly displayed, but wasn't easy to observe, so I also scaled it down.
